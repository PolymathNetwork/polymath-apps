# Polymath UI

A library for Polymath's custom UI components.

## Development

After cloning, run `yarn` to install all dependencies.

Run `yarn dev` to automatically compile and lint JS and SCSS files as they're modified. You'll need to run a manual build to update the Flow types that the package exports: `yarn build:flow` or `yarn build`.

## Testing

To run test once:
`yarn test`

To watch for file changes:
`yarn test --watch`
