            <li>
              Mint tokens to existing shareholders and your reserve, or for
              investors that may have participated in a SAFT or pre-sale
              (optional).
            </li>
            <li>
              Whitelist investors after their suitability has been assessed.
              Investors can be added to or removed from the whitelist before,
              during and after the STO, allowing you to continuously add to your
              investor pool. Note that only investors whose ether addresses are
              included in the whitelist can participate into the STO or receive
              tokens.
            </li>
            <li>
              Select a security token offering template and configure the
              specifics of your security token offering.
