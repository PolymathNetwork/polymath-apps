### Performance Improvements

- **issuer:** optimize USDTieredSTO form ([08bfe78](https://github.com/PolymathNetwork/polymath-apps/commit/08bfe78))
- **js:** tweak gas values to speed transactions up ([05576d8](https://github.com/PolymathNetwork/polymath-apps/commit/05576d8))

### Reverts

- **js:** revert gas price to original value ([fefd8fe](https://github.com/PolymathNetwork/polymath-apps/commit/fefd8fe))
- **offchain:** roll back email templates ([5e5df75](https://github.com/PolymathNetwork/polymath-apps/commit/5e5df75))

### BREAKING CHANGES

- **js:** the package now exports an async setupContracts function which _MUST_ be called before doing anything else with the contracts. This function receives the Polymath Registry address as a parameter and retrieves all the static contract addresses from it to set them
- **offchain:** Uses Polymath Registry to get addresses and removes Log from event names
- **shared:** the new contract ABIs are not compatible with the previous core versions
- **shared:** this upgrades to a non-backwards compatible of polymath-core
- **ui:** these changes leave the app unable to communicate with the current production offchain version. They are made so as to comply with the new offchain API implementation
